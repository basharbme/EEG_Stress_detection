# EEG_Stress_detection_reduction
Motive - Automatically detect and classify “interictal-ictal continuum” (IIC) patterns from EEG data.
Current progress : 
1. Publishing a journal paper on the topic ‘Stress detection and reduction methods using machine learning algorithms RVJSTM
2. Usuage of Support Vector Machine to classify the alpha and theta brainwaves according to whether the person is stressed or not.
3. LSTM algorithm for proving that meditation and calm music can increase the alpha waves and lower the theta waves and hence reduce stress as whole.
